# Projects
This is a collection of school and personal projects I have created over the years. 
The main folders are:

1) Parallel computing: This was a class I took with Professor Pacheco at University of San Francisco. The focus of this class was to learn parallel computing by utilizing distributed-memory system using the MPI protocol and shared-memory programming with Pthreads.

2) Data structures and Algorithms: This was a class I took with Professor Galles at University of San Francisco. The focus of this class was to master.
